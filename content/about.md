I started out getting a bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design in Christchurch, NZ, but I have always been fascinated by technology, computers and, particularly, the internet.

After completing my degree in 2006, I got a job in Christchurch developing interactive medical animations in Adobe Flash. From there I taught myself Actionscript 3.0 and moved on to developing more complex applications including early augmented reality in the browser. I also taught myself HTML, CSS and JQuery.

In 2011 I moved to Melbourne, Australia and started working as a front-end developer for a small agency building websites and applications, in HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Flash, that I integrated with custom PHP frameworks.

In 2014 I moved to London, UK and started work for a company building set-top boxes for televisions. The UI was built in HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript, and ran in customised versions of Chrome (for faster devices) and QT Browser (for slower devices). This was a fascinating project and I learned a vast amount. From achieving complex functionality in plain javascript with no libraries, to integrating with platform APIs, and squeezing the maximum performance from relatively underpowered hardware.

In 2016 I returned to Christchurch and started working at a cyber security and analytics company developing various sites and visualisation tools. I was involved in building React, Angular, and vanilla Javascript applications, building a component library, as well as visual design and UX. It was particularly interesting as it involved application design and architecture, as well as a lot of interactive data visualisations.
