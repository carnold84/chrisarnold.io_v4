I started out getting a Bachelor of Design (Visual Communication Design) in 2006, but I have always been fascinated by technology, computers and, particularly, the internet.

After completing my degree I got a job developing interactive medical animations in Adobe Flash. From there I taught myself Actionscript 3.0 and moved onto developing more complex applications including early augmented reality in the browser. I also learnt HTML, CSS and JQuery.

In 2011 I moved to Melbourne, Australia and started work as a front-end developer for a small design agency building websites and applications in HTML, CSS, JQuery and Flash, and integrating with PHP backends.

In 2014 I moved to London, UK and started work for a company building set-top boxes for televisions. The UI was built in HTML, CSS, and plain javascript, and ran in a customised version of Chrome browser. This was a fascinating project and I learned a vast amount. From achieving complex functionality in plain javascript and no libraries, to integrating with platform apis, and squeezing the maximum performance from relatively under-powered hardware.
