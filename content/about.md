I started out getting a degree in graphic design (Bachelor of Design - Visual Communication Design) in 2006, but I have always been fascinated by technology, computers and, particularly, the internet.

After completing my degree I got a job developing interactive medical animations in Adobe Flash. From there I taught myself Actionscript 3.0 and moved on to developing more complex applications including early augmented reality in the browser. I taught myself HTML, CSS and JQuery.

In 2011 I moved to Melbourne, Australia and started working as a front-end developer for a small agency building websites and applications in HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Flash, and integrating with PHP backends.

In 2014 I moved to London, UK and started work for a company building set-top boxes for televisions. The UI was built in HTML, CSS, and pure javascript, and ran in customised versions of Chrome (for faster devices) and QT Browser (for slower devices). This was a fascinating project and I learned a vast amount. From achieving complex functionality in plain javascript with no libraries, to integrating with platform apis, and squeezing the maximum performance from relatively under-powered hardware.
